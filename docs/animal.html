<h3>Editing an Animal post</h3>

The animal post type handles the display of entries relating to specific animals at the Detroit Zoo.
        
        There are a number of important fields for an animal post:
        
        <ol>
            <li>Animal name</li>
            <li>Scientific Name</li>
            <li>Content: the main content area is where the description of the animal goes. The currently used format is a description, followed by an "At the Detroit Zoo" heading and then a description of where the animal can be found at the zoo.</li>
            <li>Animal Facts</li>
            <li>Fun Facts</li>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <li>Habitats</li>
            <li>More Info Link</li>
            <li>Off Exhibit</li>
            <li>Animal Image: this is where you can upload a single image for this animal.</li>
        </ol>
