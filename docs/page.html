<h3>Editing a page</h3>

If you're new to managing pages in WordPress, you should start by taking a look at the other tabs to the left of here which explain some basics about what pages are.
        
For detroitzoo.org, there is some custom functionality built in here.
        
        First off is the <strong>Sub Pages Accordion</strong> feature which exists in the lower right hand side of the page.
        
        This feature allows you to search, select and specify other <em>pages</em>. When a page is selected here, the contents and title of that page will appear on the frontend of the page you are editing, below this page's content. It will appear as a toggle/accordion item so that users will be able to click on the title to expand the item and view the page contents.

        Another custom feature is the <strong>Tables section</strong>. This feature allows you to create and customize tables of data for several different use cases.
