There are two extra fields available: Repeater and Table. In order to activate these fields, find them under <a href="#extra-fields">Extra Fields box</a> in the lower right of this page. Check one or both of them and then update the page. You will now be presented with the new fields at the bottom of the page.

There are various DZS use-cases that use (and require) these fields. Here are some of them:

<ul>
<li>When using this page as a <strong>sub page accordion</strong> for the "Prices" page template, a repeater field is required. This will be used as the pricing table. The "title" will be the price and the "content" will be the price description.</li>
</ul>
