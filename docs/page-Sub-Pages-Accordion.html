The sub pages accordion feature exists in the <a href="#sub-pages-accordion">lower right hand side of the page</a>.

This feature allows you to search, select and specify other <em>pages</em>. When a page is selected here, the contents and title of that page will appear on the frontend of the page you are editing, below this page's content. It will appear as a toggle/accordion item so that users will be able to click on the title to expand the item and view the page contents.
