To setup this page to reflect the mocks, there are a few things to do.

Use the available fields to populate the 2 main pricing areas.

Once completed, you will need to populate the accordion toggles with the <strong>sub pages accordion</strong> feature (as explained in one of the help tabs to the left). Populate these toggles with pages that are using the "Repeater" extra field (as explained in one of the help tabs to the left). This will cause the toggles to show the "Repeater" as a pricing table on the left, and the page content on the right.
